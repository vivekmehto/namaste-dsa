// Insertion Sort
// Insertion Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time.
// It works by taking each element from the input and inserting it into its correct position in the already sorted part of the array.
// Starting from the second element, it compares the current element with the previous ones, shifting larger elements one position ahead to make space for the current element.
// This process continues until all elements are sorted.
// Insertion Sort is efficient for small or nearly sorrted datasets and operates in-place without requiring extra memory.
// Approach:
// Start from the second element (index 1) since the first element is trivially “sorted”.
// Store the current element (curr) and compare it with all previous elements.
// Shift the previous elements one position forward if they are greater than the current element.
// Insert the current element (curr) at its correct sorted position.
// Repeat until the whole array is sorted.
// Time & Space Complexity:
// Time Complexity: O(n) Best Case Already Sorted.

// Average Case: O(n2)

// Worst Case: O(n2)Every element has to be compared and shifted back to the start.

// Space Complexity: O(1) No extra array is used; sorting is done in-place.

// Dry Run
// Input: arr = [4, 5, 1, 3, 9]

// i = 1 → curr = 5, prev = 0
// arr[0] = 4 ≤ 5 → no shifting
// Insert curr → [4, 5, 1, 3, 9]

// i = 2 → curr = 1, prev = 1
// arr[1] = 5 > 1 → shift → [4, 5, 5, 3, 9]
// arr[0] = 4 > 1 → shift → [4, 4, 5, 3, 9]
// prev = -1 → stop
// Insert curr → [1, 4, 5, 3, 9]

// i = 3 → curr = 3, prev = 2
// arr[2] = 5 > 3 → shift → [1, 4, 5, 5, 9]
// arr[1] = 4 > 3 → shift → [1, 4, 4, 5, 9]
// arr[0] = 1 ≤ 3 → stop
// Insert curr → [1, 3, 4, 5, 9]

// i = 4 → curr = 9, prev = 3
// arr[3] = 5 ≤ 9 → no shifting
// Insert curr → [1, 3, 4, 5, 9]

// Final Sorted Array: [1, 3, 4, 5, 9]

// Output: [1, 3, 4, 5, 9]
