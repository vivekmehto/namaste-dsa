Problem Statement:
Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.

Examples:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5,1,2,3]

Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
Output: [2,0,1]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 500].
-100 ≤ Node.val ≤ 100
0 ≤ k ≤ 2 * 109
Approach:
First, compute the length of the list.
Adjust k using modulo: k = k % length.
Use two pointers: move one k steps ahead, then move both until the first reaches the end.
Rewire the pointers to rotate the list, breaking it at the new tail.

var rotateRight = function (head, k) {
  if (!head || !head.next || k === 0) {
    return head;
  }

  let length = 1;
  let tail = head;
  while (tail.next) {
    tail = tail.next;
    length++;
  }

  k = k % length;
  if (k === 0) return head;

  let stepsToNewHead = length - k;
  let prev = null;
  let curr = head;
  while (stepsToNewHead--) {
    prev = curr;
    curr = curr.next;
  }

  prev.next = null;
  tail.next = head;
  return curr;
};
