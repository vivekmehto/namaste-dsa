/*

Problem Statement:
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Examples:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
Input: head = []
Output: []
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5000].
-5000 ≤ Node.val ≤ 5000
Approach:
Use three pointers: prev, curr, and temp.
In each step:
Save the next node.
Point current node’s next to previous.
Move prev and curr forward.
Return prev as the new head.
Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list. We visit each node once.
Space Complexity: O(1), since we reverse the list in-place using a constant number of pointers.

var reverseList = function (head) {
  let prev = null;
  let curr = head;
  while (curr) {
    let temp = curr.next;
    curr.next = prev;
    prev = curr;
    curr = temp;
  }
  return prev;
};
