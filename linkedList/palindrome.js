/*

Problem Statement:
Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.

Examples:
Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
Approach 1:
Traverse the linked list and store values in an array.
Check whether the array is a palindrome by comparing elements from start and end moving towards the center.
Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes.
Space Complexity: O(n), for the array storage.

var isPalindrome = function (head) {
  let arr = [];
  let curr = head;
  while (curr !== null) {
    arr.push(curr.val);
    curr = curr.next;
  }
  let left = 0,
    right = arr.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    if (arr[left++] !== arr[right--]) return false;
  }
  return true;
};

// Approach 2:
// Use two pointers (slow and fast) to find the middle of the linked list.
// Reverse the second half of the list.
// Compare the first and second halves node by node.
// Time and Space Complexity:
// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(1)

var isPalindrome = function (head) {
  let slow = head,
    fast = head;

  while (fast && fast.next) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
  }

  // Reverse second half
  let prev = null;
  while (slow) {
    let temp = slow.next;
    slow.next = prev;
    prev = slow;
    slow = temp;
  }

  // Compare two halves
  let first = head,
    second = prev;
  while (second) {
    if (first.val !== second.val) return false;
    first = first.next;
    second = second.next;
