/*Problem Statement:
Find the middle node of a singly linked list using the slow and fast pointer approach.

Approach:
Use two pointers: slow and fast.
Initialize both at the head of the list.
Move slow one step and fast two steps at a time.
When fast reaches the end, slow will be at the middle.
Examples:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node is node 3.
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: There are two middle nodes: 3 and 4. We return the second one.
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 100
Time & Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Use Case:
This technique is efficient with O(n) time and O(1) space, commonly used in problems like finding the start of a loop, checking palindromes, etc.

var middleNode = function (head) {
  let slow = head;
  let fast = head;
  while (fast && fast.next) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
  }
  return slow;
};
