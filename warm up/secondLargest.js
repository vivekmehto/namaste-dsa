/* Problem Statement:
Write a function secondLargest(arr) that returns the second largest distinct number in an array.

Requirements:
The array must contain at least two elements.
If all elements are equal, return: No second largest found.
If the array has fewer than two elements, return: Array should have at least two numbers.
Examples:
Input: arr = [0, 3, 5, 2, 7, 9] → Output: 7

Input: arr = [4, 4, 4, 4] → Output: No second largest found

Input: arr = [5] → Output: Array should have at least two numbers

Input: arr = [10, 20] → Output: 10

Constraints:
Time Complexity: O(n) — Single pass through the array.

Space Complexity: O(1) — Constant space.

Approach:
Check array length. If fewer than 2 elements, return appropriate message.
Use two variables: firstLargest and secondLargest.
Ignore duplicates by checking num !== firstLargest before assigning secondLargest. */


function secondLargest(arr){
    if (arr.length < 2) return "Array should have at least two numbers";
    
    let first = - Infinity, second = -Infinity;

    for(let i =0; i<arr.length; i++){
        if(arr[i] > first){
            second = first;
            first = arr[i];
        }else if(arr[i] > second && arr[i] !== first){
            second = arr[i];
        }
    }


    return second === -Infinity ? "No second largest found" : second;
}
