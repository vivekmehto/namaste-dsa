/* Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1’s in the array.

Examples
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. 
The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
    
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
    Output: 2
    
Constraints:
1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
Optimal Approach – Single Pass
Initialize two variables:

currentCount → to count current streak of 1s
maxCount → to keep track of the maximum streak seen so far
Traverse the array:

If nums[i] == 1, increment currentCount
If nums[i] == 0, compare currentCount with maxCount, update maxCount, then reset currentCount to 0
After the loop, return the maximum of maxCount and currentCount (to handle case where array ends in 1s)

Dry Run
Input: nums = [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
    
    i = 0 → nums[i] = 1 → currentCount = 1
    i = 1 → nums[i] = 1 → currentCount = 2
    i = 2 → nums[i] = 0 → maxCount = 2, currentCount = 0
    i = 3 → nums[i] = 1 → currentCount = 1
    i = 4 → nums[i] = 1 → currentCount = 2
    i = 5 → nums[i] = 1 → currentCount = 3
    
    Final return: max(2, 3) = 3
    
Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n) → One pass through the array of n elements
Space Complexity: O(1) → No extra space used beyond a few variables */
