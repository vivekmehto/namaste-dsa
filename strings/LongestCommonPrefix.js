//  Longest Common Prefix
// This problem focuses on finding the longest common prefix string shared among an array of strings. If no common prefix exists, the result should be an empty string.

// Steps
// Initialize a pointer x to track character positions in the first string.
// Iterate through each character of the first string using while loop.
// For every character at position x in the first string, compare it with the character at the same position in the other strings.
// If a mismatch is found or if the current index exceeds the length of any string, return the substring from the first string from 0 to x.
// If the loop completes without any mismatch, return the first string entirely (it is the common prefix).
// Dry Run
// Input: ["flower", "flow", "flight"]

// x = 0: Compare ‘f’ with all → match
// x = 1: Compare ‘l’ → match
// x = 2: Compare ‘o’ vs ‘i’ → mismatch
// Return "fl"
// Time & Space Complexity
// Time Complexity: O(n·m), where n is the number of strings and m is the length of the shortest string
// Space Complexity: O(1), as no extra space is used apart from variables -->
